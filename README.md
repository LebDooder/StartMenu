SKOLM
=========
Some kind of lua menu

My goal is fuzzy but relatively straight forward.. Build a feature rich start menu like you see in most games, while using Chili for the GUI. ( Personally my most memorable GUI was UT99 ). My original goal was for BAR specifically. However it made more sense to build something generic I could then fork for BAR. Hopefully other games will find some use in it as well.

Also; Chili, some of the Spring API, and various other lua parts could use improvement. If I accomplish only one thing I'd like it to be creating something that makes these areas more apparent and easier to tackle.


Testing
=========
Either download zip from github or git clone to skolm.sdd in your spring Games dir. Then run as if it was any other game.
